description: James Oliver Curwood was one of the highest-paid writers of his time,
  and many of the action-adventure scribe's books were made into films during the
  early age of movie-making. The Golden Snare is a gripping tale that pits a rookie
  member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against a shadowy fugitive whose preternatural
  ability to survive in the wild makes him a formidable opponent.
